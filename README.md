# Footpatrol PID Scraper

currentpids.txt contains the PIDs of all released products in FP and the upcoming releases.

Can run meshscraper.py using python 3.6 to get PIDs for future releases, i.e. the PIDs for the products that have been added to the website(which may or may not visible in the footpatrol app) and not in currentpids.txt file.

It scrapes **1 million image urls** looking for valid images of products. Should take about 3-4 minutes to run with a normal internet connection.
